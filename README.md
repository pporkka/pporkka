## It's me. who 'me' is, you need to read on

Name: Pauli Porkka  
Based in Finland, available in LinkedIn. Look me up.

### What have I been doing?
 
Couple of decades spent everything from designing and programming software on an information retrieval domain, building installers, running small company's servers and small time SaaS-solution (private "cloud"), Security, SQL Server queries/performance tuning etc. Basically almost everything related to software products.

Couple of employments later, currently a "Technical Security lead" on a Product Security team working on miscellaneuous product related security things such as Threat modeling, CVEs, pentests, security assessments etc.  

### Where I started?

Started with a Commodore VIC20 as pre-teen (yeah, that old), moved on to Commodore C128 and from there moved on to various Amiga hardware where I started my programming hobby with Motorola 68k Assembly language. Built moderately succesfull shareware software, which may or may not be on some Amiga repositories to this date.
